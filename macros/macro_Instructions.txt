This is a small instruction to include macros in gmoccapy.

In your INI File you need to introduce a section called [MACROS]
and for every macro you wan't to include one line like so:

MACRO = jog_around
or 
MACRO = increment xinc yinc

where xinc and yinc are place holders

During excecution of the macro, you will be asked to enter the values. 

You are allowed to introduce 9 macros! 
If you enter more macros, only the first 9 will apear with button in gmoccapy.

In the [RS274NGC] section you may want to give a path to your macros like so:

[RS274NGC]
SUBROUTINE_PATH = nc_files/subroutines 

or you place your macros in the nc_files folder.

Each macro must have it's own file in one of the mentioned folders and they are normal subroutines, so the must begin with:

O<jog_around> sub

and end with

O<jog_around> endsub
M2

The name of the file must be jog_around.ngc.
And an macro must contain at least one movement of one axis.

macro name in INI file have to be the same as the file name and the sub must have also the same name (case sensitive!)!

BE CARFULL:
At this development step, the macros can only be interupted by pressing the machine off button or the emergency exit button! I will check how to make this more secure! 

Hope this does help.
